# Gemini MCP Usage Guide: Complete AI Development Workflows

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites Setup
```bash
# Keep Gemini updated
npm install -g @google/gemini-cli

# Verify installation
gemini --version

# Authenticate with personal Gmail
gemini auth

# Install MCP server
claude mcp add gemini-cli -s user -- npx -y gemini-mcp-tool

# Run setup for 20 commands
./gemini-setup.sh
```

### âš¡ Automatic Model Selection
Commands automatically use the optimal model:
- **gemini-2.5-flash** (default): Most commands, avoids rate limits
- **gemini-2.5-pro**: Complex analysis only (may hit rate limits)

No manual configuration needed!

### 2. Choose Your Activation Method

#### Option A: Full Workflow Integration (Recommended)
```
Gemini MCP server is my AI development advisor with 20 specialized commands.

DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW:
When working on any task:
1. Create initial plan using TodoWrite for task tracking
2. Check plan with /gemini-plan or /gemini-proceed before starting
3. Implement changes methodically, using /gemini-approach for decisions
4. Use /gemini-review regularly during development
5. When Gemini suggests changes, use /gemini-implement then /gemini-verify
6. Use /gemini-iterate to refine until Gemini approves
7. For complex tasks, use workflow commands like /gemini-build-cycle

COMMAND CATEGORIES:
CORE (8): plan, approach, function, review, explain, fix, security, ask
ADVANCED (4): test, audit, optimize, refactor  
RESPONSE (4): implement, verify, iterate, proceed
WORKFLOW (4): fix-cycle, build-cycle, secure-cycle, optimize-cycle

REMEMBER:
- Use Gemini throughout development, not just for finding problems
- Ask Gemini to search the web for latest documentation when needed
- Consider architecture, dependencies, and connections in all work
- Test changes continuously with Gemini verification
```

#### Option B: Simple Commands Only
```
Gemini MCP server is available. Use slash commands:
/gemini-plan, /gemini-review, /gemini-fix, /gemini-security, /gemini-test,
/gemini-audit, /gemini-optimize, /gemini-implement, /gemini-verify, etc.
Or use direct commands: "Use gemini to analyze this file"
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Complete Development Workflows

### Example 1: Building a New Feature (Manual Steps)
```bash
# 1. Initial planning
/gemini-plan
> "user profile management with avatar upload"

# 2. Confirm approach
/gemini-proceed
> "Use S3 for avatars, add profile table with user_id foreign key"

# 3. Build incrementally
# ... write initial code ...
/gemini-review  # Get early feedback

# 4. Act on feedback
/gemini-implement
> "Add file size validation, sanitize filenames, use UUID for S3 keys"

# 5. Verify implementation
/gemini-verify  # Ensure all suggestions implemented

# 6. Generate tests
/gemini-test  # Create comprehensive test suite

# 7. Security check
/gemini-security  # Final security audit

# 8. Iterate if needed
/gemini-iterate  # Get final improvements
```

### Example 2: Using Workflow Commands (Automated)
```bash
# Option A: Complete feature cycle
/gemini-build-cycle
> "Add user profile management with avatar upload"
# Automatically handles: planning â†’ implementation â†’ testing â†’ review â†’ iteration

# Option B: Security-focused development
/gemini-secure-cycle
> "Payment processing with Stripe integration"
# Automatically handles: security audit â†’ secure implementation â†’ verification â†’ re-audit

# Option C: Performance optimization
/gemini-optimize-cycle
> "Dashboard loading takes 5+ seconds"
# Automatically handles: analysis â†’ optimization â†’ verification â†’ measurement
```

### Example 3: Debugging Workflow
```bash
# Manual approach
1. /gemini-fix â†’ "TypeError in user registration"
2. /gemini-implement â†’ "Add null checks and validation"
3. /gemini-verify â†’ Confirm fix works
4. /gemini-test â†’ Generate tests to prevent regression

# Automated approach
/gemini-fix-cycle
> "TypeError in user registration"
# Handles entire fix process automatically
```

### Example 4: Iterative Development Pattern
```bash
# Start simple, iterate with Gemini
1. Write basic implementation
2. /gemini-review â†’ Get improvement suggestions
3. /gemini-implement â†’ Apply suggestions
4. /gemini-iterate â†’ Get feedback on changes
5. Repeat until Gemini approves

# This creates a tight feedback loop for quality code
```

## ðŸ”§ Pro Tips

### File Selection Strategy
- **@package.json** - Always included for project context
- **@src/*** - Includes all source files for comprehensive analysis
- **@*.config.*** - Configuration files for security/setup analysis
- **@{currentFile}** - Currently open file in Claude Code

### Command Optimization
- **Use specific commands** for targeted analysis
- **Combine commands** for comprehensive reviews
- **Select relevant code** before running commands for focused analysis
- **Use project-wide commands** (audit, optimize) periodically

### Best Practices
- **Start with workflow commands** for complex tasks
- **Use response handlers** to act on Gemini's feedback
- **Iterate frequently** with `/gemini-iterate` for quality
- **Verify always** with `/gemini-verify` after changes
- **Security first** - Run `/gemini-security` on all user input
- **Test everything** - Use `/gemini-test` for new code
- **Ask Gemini to search** - "search the web for React 19 best practices"

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Rate Limit Errors (429)
- **Most commands use flash** to avoid this issue
- **Complex commands (plan, audit, etc.) use pro** and may hit limits
- **Solutions:**
  - Wait 5-10 minutes for rate limit reset
  - Manually switch to flash: `gemini -m gemini-2.5-flash`
  - Use simpler commands during high usage

### Commands Not Appearing
- Restart Claude Code after setup
- Verify MCP server: `claude mcp list` should show `gemini-cli`

### Authentication Issues
- Re-authenticate: `gemini auth`
- Check MCP server status: `claude mcp get gemini-cli`
- Must use personal Gmail (workspace accounts don't work)

### File Analysis Errors
- MCP handles missing files gracefully
- Ensure files exist in expected locations
- Check project structure matches command expectations

### Performance Issues
- Large projects may take longer to analyze
- Use specific file selection for faster results
- Flash model is faster than pro for most tasks
