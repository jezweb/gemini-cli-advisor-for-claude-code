# Complete Workflow Integration for Claude Code + Gemini

Full development cycle examples showing how all the pieces work together.

## üé¨ Complete Feature Development Workflow

```
From now on, when I ask you to build any feature, follow this complete Gemini-integrated workflow:

1. FEATURE PLANNING (Before any code):
   echo "Feature request: [exactly what user asked for]" | gemini -p "
   /chat save feature-[feature-name]-$(date +%s)
   
   Break this down into:
   1. Core requirements
   2. Technical components needed
   3. Security considerations
   4. Database changes
   5. API endpoints
   6. Frontend components
   7. Test scenarios
   8. Potential edge cases
   9. Performance concerns
   10. Suggested implementation order"

2. ARCHITECTURE CONSULTATION:
   echo "Feature: [feature name]
   Gemini's breakdown: [summary from step 1]
   Current architecture: [brief description]
   
   How to integrate without breaking existing patterns?" | 
   gemini -p "/chat resume architecture-master-$(date +%Y%m%d)"

3. SECURITY PLANNING:
   echo "Feature security review: [feature name]
   Data handled: [what data types]
   User interactions: [how users interact]
   
   Security requirements and potential vulnerabilities?" | 
   gemini -p "/chat resume security-master-$(date +%Y%m%d)"

4. IMPLEMENTATION:
   For EACH component from the plan:
   
   a) Before coding:
      echo "Implementing: [component name]
      Purpose: [what it does]
      Interfaces with: [other components]
      
      Best practices and patterns?" | gemini -p "Implementation guidance"
   
   b) After coding:
      echo "[show the code]
      
      Review for improvements and issues" | gemini -p "Code review"
   
   c) Security check:
      echo "[show the code]
      
      Security vulnerabilities?" | gemini -p "/chat resume security-master-$(date +%Y%m%d)"

5. TESTING:
   echo "Feature implemented: [feature name]
   Components: [list components]
   
   Generate comprehensive test suite" | gemini -p "Create test plan and tests"

6. FINAL REVIEW:
   git diff [start-commit]..HEAD | gemini -p "
   Final review of feature implementation.
   Check: completeness, security, performance, best practices"

7. DOCUMENTATION:
   echo "Feature completed: [feature name]
   What it does: [functionality]
   
   Generate user-facing documentation" | gemini -p "Create documentation"

Show me the plan after step 1, then proceed with implementation.
```

## üêõ Complete Bug Fix Workflow

```
When I report any bug, follow this comprehensive debugging workflow:

1. INITIAL DIAGNOSIS:
   echo "Bug report: [user's description]
   Symptoms: [what's happening]
   Expected: [what should happen]
   
   Diagnostic plan?" | gemini -p "/chat save bug-$(date +%s)"

2. REPRODUCE & INVESTIGATE:
   # Try to reproduce, then:
   echo "Bug reproduction results:
   [What you found]
   Error messages: [any errors]
   
   Where to investigate next?" | gemini -p "Guide investigation"

3. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
   echo "Investigation findings:
   [List what you discovered]
   Suspected cause: [your hypothesis]
   
   Confirm root cause?" | gemini -p "Verify root cause"

4. FIX PLANNING:
   echo "Root cause: [confirmed cause]
   Affected code: [what needs changing]
   
   Best fix approach? Side effects to watch?" | 
   gemini -p "Plan bug fix"

5. IMPLEMENTATION:
   # Implement fix, then:
   echo "Bug fix implemented:
   [Show the fix]
   
   Is this correct and complete?" | gemini -p "Verify fix"

6. REGRESSION PREVENTION:
   echo "Bug fixed: [description]
   Root cause: [cause]
   
   Write tests to prevent regression" | gemini -p "Generate regression tests"

7. SIMILAR ISSUES CHECK:
   echo "Fixed bug pattern: [pattern description]
   
   Other places with similar code?" | gemini -p "Find similar vulnerabilities"

Report progress at each step.
```

## üîÑ Daily Development Cycle

```
Implement this daily development cycle with Gemini:

MORNING STARTUP:
1. echo "Starting work on project: $(basename $(pwd))
   git status: $(git status -s)
   
   Yesterday's work: $(git log --oneline -5)
   
   Today's priorities?" | gemini -p "/chat resume daily-dev"

2. echo "Pending tasks: [list any known tasks]
   
   Optimal order of work?" | gemini -p "Plan daily tasks"

DURING DEVELOPMENT:
- Every 30 minutes: Run the automated checks from automated-checks.md
- Before each task: Consult relevant master (security/architecture/performance)
- After each completion: Quick review with Gemini

BEFORE BREAKS:
echo "Work checkpoint:
Completed: [what you finished]
In progress: [current state]
Next: [what's next]

Anything to reconsider?" | gemini -p "Checkpoint review"

END OF DAY:
echo "Daily summary:
Completed: [list completions]
Challenges: [any issues faced]
Tomorrow: [planned work]

Key learnings? Architecture concerns?" | 
gemini -p "/memory add Daily summary: $(date)"

This maintains continuous quality and knowledge transfer.
```

   gemini -p "/chat resume architecture-master-$(date +%Y%m%d)"

4. TECH STACK VALIDATION:
   echo "Planned stack:
   [List each technology choice]
   
   Validate choices and suggest alternatives if needed" | 
   gemini -p "Validate technology choices"

5. INITIAL SCAFFOLDING:
   For each core component:
   echo "Scaffolding: [component]
   Role: [what it does]
   
   Best initial structure?" | gemini -p "Guide scaffolding"

6. DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS:
   echo "Establish patterns for:
   - Error handling
   - Logging
   - Authentication
   - API responses
   - Database access
   
   Show examples for this stack" | 
   gemini -p "Establish project patterns"

This ensures projects start with best practices built-in.
```

## üîç Code Review Workflow

```
When you finish any significant code change:

1. SELF-REVIEW WITH GEMINI:
   git diff | gemini -p "Pre-review checklist:
   - Logic errors?
   - Security issues?
   - Performance problems?
   - Missing edge cases?
   - Test coverage?"

2. ARCHITECTURE CONSISTENCY:

Only proceed with commit after all checks pass.
```

## üîÑ Refactoring Workflow

```
When code needs refactoring:

1. REFACTORING PLANNING:
   echo "Need to refactor: [what and why]
   Current issues: [problems]
   Goals: [desired outcome]
   
   Refactoring strategy?" | 
   gemini -p "/chat save refactor-$(date +%s)"

2. RISK ASSESSMENT:
   echo "Refactoring plan: [Gemini's strategy]
   Affected areas: [what touches this code]
   
   Risk assessment and mitigation?" | 
   gemini -p "Refactoring risk analysis"

3. INCREMENTAL APPROACH:
   echo "Full refactoring scope: [all changes needed]
   
   Break into safe incremental steps" | 
   gemini -p "Plan incremental refactoring"

4. EACH REFACTOR STEP:
   a) Before:
      echo "Refactor step [N]: [what you're changing]
      
      Safety checks?" | gemini -p "Pre-refactor verification"
   
   b) After:
      git diff | gemini -p "Verify refactor correctness"
   
   c) Test:
      echo "Refactored: [what changed]
      
      Tests to verify behavior unchanged?" | 
      gemini -p "Generate refactor tests"

5. COMPLETION REVIEW:
   git diff [start]..HEAD | gemini -p "
   Full refactoring review.
   Verify: goals met, no regressions, improvements achieved"

This ensures safe, effective refactoring.
```

## üö® Production Issue Workflow
